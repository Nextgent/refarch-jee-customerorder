# Step 2. Build & run the Liberty app locally talking to remote DB2 and LDAP servers

In this step, we are going to build and run the Liberty app locally and connect it to the remote DB2 and LDAP servers simulating what would be a real production scenario.

1. [Get Started](#get-started)
2. [Build the Liberty app](#build-the-liberty-app)
    * [Get the project repository](#get-the-project-repository)
    * [Build the ear file using Maven](#build-the-ear-file-using-maven)
3. [Configure the Liberty server](#configure-the-liberty-server)
4. [Deploy and run the app](#deploy-and-run-the-app)


### Get started

Before building the application, on your skytap machine, go to **/home/skytap/PurpleCompute**. This is the home directory from where we run the lab:

1. Login to your skytap machine.
2. Open your terminal.
3. Enter `cd PurpleCompute`

### Build the Liberty app

#### Get the project repository

You can clone the repository from its main GitHub repository page and checkout the appropriate branch for this version of the application.

1. `cd git`
2. `git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee-customerorder.git`
3. `cd refarch-jee-customerorder`
4. `git checkout liberty`

#### Build the ear file using Maven

Maven is a good project management tool. It is based on Project Object Model (POM). Maven is generally used for projects build, dependency and documentation. Basically, it simplifies the project build. We are using Maven for building our project ear.

1. `cd CustomerOrderServicesProject`
2. `mvn clean package`

This command will build **CustomerOrderServicesApp-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.ear** in **target** directory of **CustomerOrderServicesApp** for you. You can see the below message once the build is successful.

```

### Configure the Liberty server

Before running the application on the Liberty server, we need to configure it. As we said in this tutorial in step 1, the Liberty server is configured by using config files rather than through an administration console as in previous WebSphere Application Server versions. These configuration files are called **server.xml** and **server.env** which reside in the liberty server directory.

For this tutorial, we provide you with these configuration files ready to be used out of the box so that the Customer Order Services application works right away in Liberty. You only need to copy them from the GitHub repository location, which you have just downloaded to your machine, to the Liberty server directory on your machine:

1. Copy server.xml into the Liberty server directory
```
cp /home/skytap/PurpleCompute/refarch-jee-customerorder/tutorial/tutorialConfigFiles/step2/server.xml \
   /home/skytap/PurpleCompute/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer
```
2. Copy server.env into the Liberty server directory 
```
cp /home/skytap/PurpleCompute/refarch-jee-customerorder/tutorial/tutorialConfigFiles/step2/server.env \
   /home/skytap/PurpleCompute/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer
```

### Deploy and run the app

Now, we want to deploy the ear file our Customer Order Services application got build into. In order to do so, we need to drop this ear file into an specific folder within the Liberty server installation directory.

1. `cd /home/skytap/PurpleCompute/git/refarch-jee-customerorder/CustomerOrderServicesApp/target` <sup>\*</sup>_(You should see the build output ear file called **CustomerOrderServicesApp-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.ear**)_
2. `cp CustomerOrderServicesApp-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.ear /home/skytap/PurpleCompute/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/apps`
  
  
Now, you are done with the configuration and the app is ready for deployment. To run the app on Liberty,

1. Go into the Liberty server binaries folder: `cd /home/skytap/PurpleCompute/wlp/bin`
2. Before starting the server, to make sure all the utilities are installed, run the following command: `./installUtility install defaultServer` <sup>\*</sup>_(If it prompts you to accept the license by pressing 1, please accept it)_
3. Start the server: `./server start defaultServer`
4. Open your browser and point it to http://localhost:9080/CustomerOrderServicesWeb/#shopPage
6. Login as the user `rbarcia` with the password of `bl0wfish`

7. Finally, stop the server: `./server stop defaultServer`
