# Customer Order Services - JavaEE Enterprise Application

## Application Overview

The application is a simple store-front shopping application, built during the early days of the Web 2.0 movement.  As such, it is in major need of upgrades from both the technology and business point of view.  Users interact directly with a browser-based interface and manage their cart to submit orders.  This application is built using the traditional [3-Tier Architecture](http://www.tonymarston.net/php-mysql/3-tier-architecture.html) model, with an HTTP server, an application server, and a supporting database.

![Phase 0 Application Architecture](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee/raw/master/static/imgs/apparch-pc-phase0-customerorderservices.png)

There are several components of the overall application architecture:
- Starting with the database, the application leverages two SQL-based databases running on [IBM DB2](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/db2/).
- The application exposes its data model through an [Enterprise JavaBean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_JavaBeans) layer, named **CustomerOrderServices**.  This components leverages the [Java Persistence API](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/What_is_JPA%3F) to exposed the backend data model to calling services with minimal coding effort.
  - As of the [WebSphere Application Server](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/appserv-was) Version 9 build, the application is using **EJB 3.0** and **JPA 2.0** versions of the respective capabilities.
- The next tier of the application, named **CustomerOrderServicesWeb**, exposes the necessary business APIs via REST-based web services.  This component leverages the [JAX-RS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_API_for_RESTful_Web_Services) libraries for creating Java-based REST services with minimal coding effort.
  - As of the [WebSphere Application Server](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/appserv-was) Version 9 build, the application is using **JAX-RS 1.1** version of the respective capability.
- The application's user interface is exposed through the **CustomerOrderServicesWeb** component as well, in the form of a [Dojo Toolkit](#tbd)-based JavaScript application.  Delivering the user interface and business APIs in the same component is one major inhibitor our migration strategy will help to alleviate in the long-term.
- Finally, there is an additional integration testing component, named **CustomerOrderServicesTest** that is built to quickly validate an application's build and deployment to a given application server.  This test component contains both **JPA** and **JAX-RS**-based tests.

- Port number _(most likely 50000)_
- Database name _(most likely BLUDB)_
- User ID _(most likely bluadmin)_
- Password _(previous password from the `View credentials` tab)_

### Step 5: Create WebSphere Application Server service instance

1. Go to your [Bluemix console](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/) and create a [**WebSphere Application Server** instance](https://console-regional.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/websphere-application-server)

2. Name your service, choose the **WAS Base Plan**, and create the instance.

3. Once the service instance is created, provision a **WebSphere Version 9.0.0.0** server of size **Medium**.  This should be a server deployment taking up 2 of your 2 trial credits.  This step can take up to 30 minutes to complete.

4. Once done, you can access the Admin console using the **Open the Admin Console** option. In order to access the Admin console, install the [VPN](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/ApplicationServeronCloud/systemAccess.html#setup_openvpn) as instructed. 

   - [Windows 64-Bit (OpenVPN)](https://swupdate.openvpn.org/community/releases/openvpn-install-2.3.11-I001-x86_64.exe)
   - [Windows 32-Bit (OpenVPN)](https://swupdate.openvpn.org/community/releases/openvpn-install-2.3.11-I001-i686.exe)
   - [Linux (OpenVPN)](https://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/download-openvpn-as-sw.html)
   - [Mac (Tunnelblick)](https://tunnelblick.net/)  
   
   Download, extract, and install the VPN configuration files by clicking the **Download** button.
   
   **VPN - Windows Configuration**
   
   1. From the [openVPN Windows download](http://swupdate.openvpn.org/community/releases/) link, download
      [openvpn-install-2.3.4-I001-x86_64.exe](https://swupdate.openvpn.org/community/releases/openvpn-install-2.3.4-I001-x86_64.exe) for 64-bit, or
      [openvpn-install-2.3.4-I001-i686.exe](https://swupdate.openvpn.org/community/releases/openvpn-install-2.3.4-I001-i686.exe) for 32-bit.
      
   2. Ensure you [Run as a Windows Administrator](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff431742.aspx) and openVPN is installed.
   
   3. Download the VPN configuration files from the OpenVPN download link of the WebSphere Application Server in Bluemix instance in the service dashboard. Extract all four files in the compressed file to the {OpenVPN home}\config directory. 
   
   `C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\Config`
   
   4. Start the openVPN client program "OpenVPN GUI". Ensure that you select [Run as a Windows Administrator](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff431742.aspx) to start the program. If you do not, you might not be able to connect.

   **VPN - Linux Configuration**
 
   1. To install openVPN, follow the [instructions](https://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/docs/admin-guides/182-how-to-connect-to-access-server-with-linux-clients.html).
   
      If you need to manually download and install the RPM Package Manager, go to [openVPN unix/linux download](https://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/download-openvpn-as-sw.html). You might need assistance from your Linux administrator.

   2. Download the VPN configuration files from the OpenVPN download link of the WebSphere Application Server in Bluemix instance in the service dashboard. Extract the files into the directory from which you plan to start the openVPN client. You need all four files in the same directory.
   
   3. Start the openVPN client program. Open a terminal window and go to the directory that contains the config files. Run the following command as root:
   
   `openvpn --config vt-wasaas-wasaas.ovpn`
   
   **VPN - MAC configuration**
   
   1. One method is to install [Tunnelblick](https://tunnelblick.net/), an open source software product.
   
   2. Extract the VPN configuration files from the WebSphere service. Tunnelblick prompts for your admin password for Mac and adds the config to the set of VPNs you can use to connect.
   
   3. Connect to the VPN network and then you can access your virtual machine. After your first access, Tunnelblick caches the configuration and you can connect from [Tunnelblick](https://tunnelblick.net/). You can put an icon on the top menu bar for easy access.
   
Once the VPN is configured, you can access the Admin console. Please add the exception for insecure connection when it prompts to access the admin console.
   
5. Get a public IP address. This can be done using the [**Manage Public IP Access**](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/ApplicationServeronCloud/networkEnvironment.html#networkEnvironment) option. 

6. You can **ssh** into the WebSphere Application Server instance using the Admin Username **root** and Password provided in your bluemix instance.

   In **Application Hosts/Nodes**, by expanding the Traditional **WebSphere Base option**, you can find the details of your OS distribution, Admin username, Admin password and Key Store password.

### Step 6: Perform WebSphere configuration

1. You will need to add a new firewall rule to the WebSphere instance to communicate with the remote LDAP server.  While **ssh**'ed into the WebSphere instance, run the following commands to allow traffic between WAS and LDAP via our Secure Gateway connection.

`sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 169.54.229.5 -j ACCEPT`  
`sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -d  169.54.229.5 -j ACCEPT`  
`sudo  /sbin/service iptables save`  

2. Log into the Admin Console via the adddress accessible from your service instance page.

3. In the Global security section, check **Enable application security** and click **Save**.

##### LDAP Configuration 

In order to manually set WebSphere up to use a standalone LDAP registry for Authentication and Authorization of application users, follow these instructions:

1. Open WebSphere Admin Console and go to Security --> Global Security.

![LDAP_HOME](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee/blob/master/static/imgs/LDAP_Images/LDAP_home.png)

2. In the *User account repository section* at the bottom of the page, select **Standalone LDAP registry** from the *Available realm definition* dropdown menu.

3. Click on Configure...

![LDAP_CONFIGURE](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee/blob/master/static/imgs/LDAP_Images/LDAP_configure.png)

4. Set the Primary administrative user name to **uid=wasadmin,ou=caseinc,o=root**.

5. Select **IBM Tivoli Directory Server** from the Type of LDAP server dropdown menu.

6. Set the Host and Port to **cap-sg-prd-4.integration.ibmcloud.com** and **17830** respectively.

7. Set the LDAP admin credentials using the Bind distinguished name and password below:
   * Bind distinguished name (DN)     : **cn=root**
   * Bind password                    : **purpleTDS!**
 
![LDAP_TestConn](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee/blob/master/static/imgs/LDAP_Images/LDAP_TestConn.png)

8. Click on the **Test connection** button at the top to make sure your standalone LDAP server is reachable by your WebSphere Application Server.

9. Go to the Additional Properties at the bottom of the page and click on **Advanced Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) user registry settings**

![LDAP Advanced](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee/blob/master/static/imgs/LDAP_Images/LDAP_Adv.png)

10. Set the User filter and group filter.

    **User filter: (&(uid=%v)(objectclass=inetorgperson)(ou=caseinc))**
    
    **Group filter: (&(cn=%v)(objectclass=groupOfUniqueNames)(ou=caseinc))**
    
![LDAP Advanced Settings](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee/blob/master/static/imgs/LDAP_Images/LDAP_Adv_Settings.png)

11. Apply the changes and save the settings.

##### Configuring JDBC Resources

6. Under **Global Security**, expand **Java Authentication and Autorization Service** and choose **J2C authentication data**. Create a new user named **DBUser-ORDERDB** using your DB2 on Cloud instance and password.  The user will be `bluadmin` and the password will be specific to the instance you named **DB2 on Cloud - ORDERDB**.

![Readme 4](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee/raw/master/static/imgs/Customer_README/Readme4.png)

7. On the same page, create another new user named **DBUsuer-INVENTORYDB** using your DB2 on Cloud instance and password.  The user will again be `bluadmin`, but the password will be different as you are connecting to a different DB2 database on a different Bluemix service instance.

![Readme 4](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee/raw/master/static/imgs/Customer_README/Readme4.png)

1. Go to the **Resources > JDBC > JDBC Providers** section and ensure that you are at the **Cell** scope.

![Readme 5](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee/raw/master/static/imgs/Customer_README/Readme5.png)

2. Click the New Button to create a new JDBC provider.
    -  Database type : **DB2**
    -  Provider type : **DB2 Using IBM JCC Driver**
    -  Implementation type : **XA data source**

![Readme 6](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee/raw/master/static/imgs/Customer_README/Readme6.png)

3. You need to enter the database class path information. Enter the directory where the DB2 Java is set.

![Readme 7](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee/raw/master/static/imgs/Customer_README/Readme7.png)

4. Press **Next** and then **Finish**. Save the Configuration.

![Readme 8](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee/raw/master/static/imgs/Customer_README/Readme8.png)

5. Go to the **Resources > JDBC > Data sources** section to create a new data source.
   1. Make sure that the scope is at **Cell** level and click **New**
   2. OrderDB - Step 1
      -  Data source name: **OrderDS**
      -  JNDI name: **jdbc/orderds**      
         ![Readme 9](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee/raw/master/static/imgs/Customer_README/Readme9.png)
   3. OrderDB - Step 2
      - Select an existing JDBC provider --> **DB2 Using IBM JCC Driver (XA)**
        ![Readme 10](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee/raw/master/static/imgs/Customer_README/Readme10.png)
   4. ORDERDB - Step 3
      - Driver Type: **4**
      - Database name: **BLUDB**
      - Server name: **Your default DB2 host**
      - Port number: **Your default DB2 port**
        ![Readme 11](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee/raw/master/static/imgs/Customer_README/Readme11.png)
   5. OrderDB - Step 4
      - Authentication alias for XA recovery: **DB2User-ORDERDB**
      - Component-managed authentication alias: **DB2User-ORDERDB**
      - Mapping-configuration alias: **DefaultPrincipalMapping**
      - Container-managed authentication alias: **DB2User-ORDERDB**
        ![Readme 12](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee/raw/master/static/imgs/Customer_README/Readme12.png)
      
6. Once this is done, under Preferences, there will be a new resource called **OrderDS**. Make sure that the resources got connected using **Test Connection** option. You will see a success message if the connection is established successfully.

![Readme 13](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee/raw/master/static/imgs/Customer_README/Readme13.png)

7. Check the Data source and select Test Connection to ensure you created the database correctly.  If the connection fails, a few things to check are
      - Your database is started as we did in the beginning.  
      - Your host and port number are correct.
      - The classpath for the Driver is set properly.  
      - Check the WebSphere Variables.  You may want to change them to point to your local DB2 install.
8. Create the INVENTORYDB data source using the same process as before.  Click **New**.
   1. InventoryDB - Step 1
      -  Data source name: **INDS**
      -  JNDI name: **jdbc/inds**
   2. InventoryDB - Step 2
      - Select an existing JDBC provider --> **DB2 Using IBM JCC Driver (XA)**
   3. InventoryDB - Step 3
      - Driver Type: **4**
      - Database name: **BLUDB**
      - Server name: **Your default DB2 host**
      - Port number: **Your default DB2 port**
   4. InventoryDB - Step 4
      - Authentication alias for XA recovery: **DB2User-INVENTORYDB**
      - Component-managed authentication alias: **DB2User-INVENTORYDB**
      - Mapping-configuration alias: **DefaultPrincipalMapping**
      - Container-managed authentication alias: **DB2User-INVENTORYDB**
9. Remember to save and test the connection again.

**Note**: Whenever you make any changes to the WebSphere Configuration Settings, it prompts you with a warning message. Please review and save the modifications.
